This sample shows how to use the Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API and Go language (Golang) to create, retrieve, update, and delete a document in a collection. 

For instructions on using this quickstart, see Azure Cosmos DB: Build a MongoDB API console app with Golang and the Azure portal 
(link forthcoming).

Many thanks to [Durgaprasad Budhwani](https://medium.com/@durgaprasadbudhwani) for providing the code and documentation for this sample.
